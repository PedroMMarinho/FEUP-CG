# Use of AI

In general, AI was used mostly to debug shader code, research ways to optimize the most costly parts of the scene (eg. batching for fire patches, texture atlas for the helipad textures) and document code. 

AI was also used to create the code that follows the helicopter with the camera, the shader code to make the water planes tile seamlessly and the addition of a hash function to create pseudo-randomness in the phase of the fire patches.

When converting blender objects to data usable in WebGL, AI was used to create the code that converts the blender objects to a format that can be used in WebGL.

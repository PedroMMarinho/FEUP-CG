## TP 3 Notes

### Ex 2

- In this exercise we had to create a prism with two poligonal side and the remaining sides being retangular, which can be subdivided into multiple "floors"

- We had some difficulty creating mapping the vertices to faces of the prism, since this is the first time creating an object programmaticly

- We noticed that due to the fact that, on each face the normals are identical, the resulting illumination is very similar to "constant shading"

### Ex 3 

- In this exercise we had to modify the prism to use different normals

- Relatively easy compared to the previous exercise

- The resulting object is comparitivly smoother
